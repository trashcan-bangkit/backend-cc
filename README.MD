# TRASHCAN : WASTE CLASSIFIER APPLICATION

Inspired by Indonesia's waste management challenges, our team developed an app to promote sustainable practices. Trashcan Mobile Application classifies waste as organic, inorganic, or hazardous using user inputs or image recognition. It provides recycling information for organic waste and locates the nearest waste bank.
